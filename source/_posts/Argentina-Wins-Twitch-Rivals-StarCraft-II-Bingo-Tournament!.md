#  Argentina Wins Twitch Rivals StarCraft II Bingo Tournament!

In a stunning upset, the Argentine team of ajucho, darkanl and endofdays defeated some of the best players in the world to take home the first place prize in the Twitch Rivals StarCraft II Bingo Tournament. The tournament, which took place over two days last week, featured 64 of the best StarCraft II players from around the world.

The Argentine team dominated the competition, winning all five of their games in convincing fashion. In the final match, they faced off against a team made up of three Koreans players – Jjakji, Stats and Leenock. The Korean team was considered by many to be the favourites to win, but they were no match for Argentina’s ajucho and his teammates.

This was a major breakthrough for Argentine StarCraft II players, who have long been considered among the best in the world but have never quite achieved the level of success that they desired. This victory will no doubt give them a lot of confidence and will hopefully propel them to even greater things in the future.

#  Argentina Triumphs Over All Challengers In Twitch Rivals StarCraft II Bingo Tournament!

In what can only be construed as a monumental victory for the Argentinian StarCraft II community, they have triumphed over all challengers in the Twitch Rivals StarCraft II Bingo Tournament! This event, which took place on October 9th and saw 48 of the best players from around the world competing, was hailed as one of the most exciting and closely contested tournaments in recent memory.

In the end it was Argentina’s own “Semper” who came out on top, defeating Germany’s “Bly” in an intense final match that went all the way to game seven. In addition to taking home the $10,000 first prize, Semper has also cemented his place as one of the leading lights of the Argentinian StarCraft II scene.

There were plenty of other impressive performances on show during the tournament as well. Canada’s “MaSa” reached the final four before being defeated by Bly, while America’s “Neeb” and South Korea’s “soO” both made it to the semi-finals. However, it was Argentina who ultimately took home the glory, and they will be sure to celebrate this impressive achievement for many years to come!
