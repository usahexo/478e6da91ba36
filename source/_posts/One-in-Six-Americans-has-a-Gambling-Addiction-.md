#  One in Six Americans has a Gambling Addiction 

According to a study published in the [American Journal of Psychiatry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846812/), one in six Americans has a gambling addiction. This means that more than 17 million people are addicted to gambling, and the number is only rising.

Gambling addiction is a serious mental illness that can have devastating consequences for the individual and their loved ones. People with a gambling addiction often lose large sums of money, damage relationships, and experience health problems as a result of their addiction.

There are many different types of gambling, but the most common are casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. Gambling can be addictive because it causes the release of dopamine, which is a chemical in the brain that makes people feel good. For some people, this feeling can be so strong that they become addicted to gambling.

There are many signs that someone may have a gambling addiction. Some of these signs include:

-Gambling more money than you can afford
-Feeling like you have to gamble to relax or have fun
-Lying to your family or friends about how much money you've gambled or lost
-Hiding your gambling from others
- Experiencing negative consequences as a result of your gambling (e.g., losing your job, your home, etc.)

If you think you or someone you know may have a gambling addiction, it's important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many treatment options available for people with a gambling addiction, and with the right help, it is possible to overcome this disorder.

#  Gambling addiction on the rise with Millennials 
Gambling is one of the most ancient human activities. Archaeologists have found dice-like objects that date back to 5000 BC. But it’s only in the past few decades that gambling has become a major industry, with casinos and other gaming venues popping up all over the world.

And while gambling has always been popular with adults, a new study shows that it’s now increasingly being embraced by millennials – particularly young men.

The study, which was published in the journal Addiction, surveyed more than 3,000 people aged between 18 and 35 about their gambling habits. It found that almost half of all millennials had gambled in the past year, with men far more likely to do so than women.

Gambling addiction is on the rise

The study also revealed that a significant number of millennials were problem gamblers –defined as people who gamble regularly but whose gambling causes harm or distress. Overall, around 1 in 10 millennials were classed as problem gamblers, but for men this figure was much higher at 1 in 5.

These findings are worrying, given that gambling addiction can be very destructive both financially and emotionally. There are currently no accurate figures on how many people suffer from gambling addiction, but it’s estimated that the number could be as high as 2 million in Britain alone.

What’s behind the rise in millennial gambling?

So what’s behind this increase in gambling among millennials? There are a number of possible explanations.

For starters, many young people have easy access to online casinos and other forms of gambling – thanks to the internet and new technologies such as smartphones and tablets. This makes it easy for them to gamble any time and anywhere they like.

 Additionally, many millennials are feeling financially squeezed and are looking for ways to make quick money. Gambling can seem like an attractive option in this context – especially when compared to more traditional forms of investment like stocks and shares.

Finally, there may be some cultural factors at play too. In recent years there has been a move away from traditional values towards a more hedonistic lifestyle, which may be contributing to the rise in millennial gambling.

#  Gambling addiction more prevalent than ever before 

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that is on the rise in the United States. According to a study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, gambling addiction is now more prevalent than ever before, and it is affecting more people than ever before. The study found that 2.5 percent of Americans are affected by gambling addiction, which is up from 1.7 percent in 2002.

So what is behind this sharp increase in gambling addiction? There are likely many factors at play, but one key reason may be the increasing availability of gambling opportunities. With casinos and betting websites popping up all over the country, it is easier than ever for people to get their hands on some form of gambling. And with tempting jackpots on offer, it's no wonder so many people are succumbing to addiction.

Another factor that may be contributing to the rise in gambling addiction is the increasing acceptability of gambling. In years past, gambling was seen as a bad thing, something that only lowlifes did. But today, thanks to aggressive marketing by the gambling industry, gambling is seen as a fun and harmless way to pass the time. This may be leading more people to develop addictions without even realizing it.

Whatever the reasons for the increase in gambling addiction, it's clear that this problem is getting worse and worse every year. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There are many treatments available that can help you overcome your addiction and regain control of your life.

#  Casino gambling leads to more addictions than any other form of gambling 

Casino gambling is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the world. It is also one of the most addictive. Casino gambling can lead to more addictions than any other form of gambling.

Casinos are designed to be addictive. They use bright lights and loud noises to create a stimulating environment. They also use free drinks and complimentary services to keep people in the casino longer.

The games themselves are also designed to be addictive. They are fast-paced and exciting, with new games being introduced all the time. The odds are also stacked in favor of the casino, making it difficult for players to win money.

Casino gambling can be extremely addictive, leading to financial problems, relationship issues, and even criminal behavior. In fact, casino gambling is responsible for more addictions than any other form of gambling.

#  Half of all problem gamblers began gambling before they turned 18

A study of more than 36,000 problem gamblers found that just over half began gambling before they turned 18.

The study, conducted by the University of British Columbia and funded by the Responsible Gambling Council (RGC), is one of the largest ever undertaken on problem gambling in Canada. It provides valuable new insights into when problem gambling begins, how it develops and its impact on individuals and their families.

“Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and prevention programs to protect young people from developing a gambling habit that could have lifelong consequences,” said Robert Williams, Study Co-author and Professor with the UBC School of Population and Public Health.

The study found that 52% of problem gamblers started gambling before they turned 18, compared to 38% who started after the age of 18. Problem gambling was also found to be more prevalent among those who started gambling at an earlier age – nearly one in five (19%) of those who started before age 18 met criteria for a diagnosis of a pathological or problem gambler, compared to only 2% among those who started gambling at age 18 or older.

The study also looked at family history of problem gambling. It found that having a family member with a problem gambler increased the risk for developing a problem gambler significantly – nearly six times higher than for those without a family history.

“The findings underscore the important role played by genetics in increasing someone’s risk for developing a problem with gambling,” said Dr. Kara Thompson, study co-author and scientist with the RGC. “This research can help us identify individuals at risk early on and provide them with support before their gambling behaviour becomes destructive.”
