#  How to Keep your Spirits Up During a Poker Marathon

No one ever said that playing poker was easy. In fact, for some it can be downright grueling. Especially when you’re stuck in the midst of a long marathon session with no end in sight.

Naturally, your mood and outlook during this type of marathon will have a lot to do with how successful you ultimately are. Here are a few tips on how to keep your spirits up during these long sessions:

1. Stay hydrated: This is key for staying alert and clearheaded. Make sure to drink plenty of water (and/or other hydrating fluids) throughout the day.

2. Take breaks: This is especially important if you’ve been playing for hours on end. Get up and move around, take a walk outside, or just step away from the table for a few minutes to clear your head.

3. Eat healthy: Again, this is important for keeping your energy level high. Avoid fatty or sugary foods, and go for healthier options like fruits and vegetables instead.

4. Keep your mind occupied: When things start to get tedious or monotonous, find ways to keep yourself amused. Play games on your phone, listen to music, read a book – anything to help pass the time.

5. Don’t get discouraged: Poker is a challenging game and there will inevitably be times when you lose money or experience setbacks. Don’t let these defeats get you down; rather, use them as motivation to work harder and come back stronger next time.

#  Tips for Dealing with Poor Cards during a Poker Marathon

It’s inevitable that you will end up with some poor cards during a poker marathon. However, by following a few simple tips, you can make the most of these cards and minimize the impact on your overall results.

Tip 1: Play Aggressively

Whenever you are dealt poor cards, it’s important to play aggressively. This will put pressure on your opponents and may lead them to make mistakes. Even if you don’t manage to win any pots with your poor cards, playing aggressively will at least help you to avoid losing too much money.

Tip 2: Minimize Your Exposure

With poor cards, it’s important to be selective about the hands you choose to play. If there is a hand that you can fold without too much damage, then do so. By folding early in the hand, you can minimize your exposure and give yourself a better chance of winning when you do get a good hand later on.

Tip 3: Know When to Quit

There will inevitably be times when playing with poor cards simply isn’t worth it. If the situation looks dire and you know that the odds are against you, then it’s time to quit and cut your losses. Quitting while you’re ahead is always better than losing all of your money by continuing to play poorly.
