#  Casino Cuts Caesar Playing with 7 Decks

Casino Cuts Caesar is a blackjack expert who has played with up to eight decks at a time. But the casino he was playing at last week decided to cut him down to just seven.

"I wasn't really sure what the dealer was doing," he said. "It didn't seem like they were following basic strategy."

Indeed, the dealer wasn't following basic strategy. In fact, they were using a modified version that included cutting out one deck. This made it much harder for Casino Cuts Caesar and other players at the table to win.

"The casino was just trying to make more money off of us," he said. "They weren't interested in providing a fair game."

Although Casino Cuts Caesar didn't walk away a big winner on that particular night, he did manage to win a little bit. He says that he'll definitely continue to play blackjack, but only at casinos that are willing to provide a fair game.

#  Casino Cuts Deck for Blackjack Game 

Casino officials announced that the standard deck of playing cards would no be used for blackjack games at the casino. The decision to use a single deck for all blackjack games was made to speed up gameplay and provide a more consistent experience for players.

The casino will continue to offer double deck and six-deck blackjack games, but only the single deck game will be dealt from the shoe. The decision to use a single deck was influenced by player feedback and observations that double deck and six-deck games took too long to play.

“We are always looking for ways to improve the player experience, and believe this change will do just that,” said a casino spokesperson.

The single deck game will feature traditional blackjack rules, with the dealer standing on soft 17 and players able to Double Down on any two cards.

#  On-line Casino Begins Using 6 Decks in Blackjack Games 

In order to speed up the game and keep up with the growing popularity of blackjack, on-line casinos have begun using 6 decks in their blackjack games. While some players may be unhappy with this development, it is ultimately good for the game as a whole.

The use of more decks speeds up the game because cards are being dealt more quickly. With more decks in use, there is also less opportunity for dealers to cheat by stacking the deck. This makes the game more fair for all players.

Players who are used to playing with only 2 or 4 decks may need to adjust their strategy a bit when playing with 6 decks. For example, they may want to increase their bet size in order to make up for the increased odds of busting. Overall, however, using 6 decks makes for a faster and more fair game for all players involved.

#  More Casinos Slashing the Number of Decks in Blackjack Games 

In the hunt for an edge in gambling, casinos are increasingly turning to less decks in blackjack games. 

The strategy, which is being adopted at some of the biggest and most popular casinos in the country, including Wynn Las Vegas and MGM Grand Detroit, is an effort to thwart card counters who have been winning more money as casinos have switched to more liberal policies on blackjack in recent years. 

The number of decks used in blackjack games has come down from six or eight to four or five. The fewer decks, casinos say, make card counting less advantageous for players. 

“It’s all about giving the player the least opportunity to gain an advantage,” said Bill Zender, a casino consultant. 

Casinos have also been using devices that track how much money customers are betting and how long they are playing at individual tables. That information is used to decide what limits to place on customers and when to ask them to leave the game.

#  Decreasing Deck Numbers Result in Increased House Edge

A study recently released by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has shown that the lower the number of decks in use, the higher the house edge. The study analyzed over two million blackjack hands played between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.

The research found that with six or eight decks, the house edge was 0.17% or less. With only four decks, however, the house edge jumps to 0.44%. This means that for every $100 bet at a six-deck game, you can expect to lose an average of $0.17. At an eight-deck game, that number drops to $0.14. But at a four-deck game, you can expect to lose $0.44 for every $100 bet.

Interestingly, this trend reverses with more than eight decks. With more than eight decks in play, the house edge actually decreases to 0.15%.

While there are many factors that go into calculating house edge (including rules variations), this study provides concrete evidence that reducing the number of decks in use does have an impact on the casino’s bottom line.
