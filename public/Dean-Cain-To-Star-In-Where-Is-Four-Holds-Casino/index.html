        <h1 id="Dean-Cain-To-Star-In-Where-Is-Four-Holds-Casino"><a href="#Dean-Cain-To-Star-In-Where-Is-Four-Holds-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Dean Cain To Star In Where Is Four Holds Casino"></a>Dean Cain To Star In Where Is Four Holds Casino</h1><p>TV and movie star Dean Cain will play the lead in the upcoming independent film “Where Is Four Holds Casino.” The film is set in a small town in Nevada, where a casino has been shut down and the people are left to pick up the pieces. Cain will play the role of Ryan, a man who has lost his job and his home, and is now trying to figure out what to do next.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast is still being finalized, but producers are already looking forward to working with Cain. Said producer Nicholas D’Agosto, “Dean is not only a talented actor, but he’s also a great person. We’re excited to have him on board for this project.”</p>
<p>The filming for “Where Is Four Holds Casino” is scheduled to start in September of this year, and the movie is expected to be released sometime in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-film-to-shoot-in-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Casino-film-to-shoot-in-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Casino film to shoot in Las Vegas"></a>Casino film to shoot in Las Vegas</h1><p>Filmmakers will be shooting a casino-themed movie in Las Vegas starting this month.</p>
<p>The yet-to-be named film is being directed by Hollywood veteran Roger Avery and will star major names in the movie industry, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the plot of the film follows a heist that goes wrong in a casino in Sin City. Production is scheduled to take place at some of the most iconic casinos in Vegas such as The Mirage, Bellagio and Caesar’s Palace.</p>
<p>This will not be the first time that Las Vegas has been used as a backdrop for a movie; it has also been featured in blockbusters such as Ocean’s Eleven and The Hangover. However, with a cast of this calibre and a director with an impressive resume, expectations are high for the new casino film.</p>
<p>In preparation for the shoot, many of the casinos have been busy sprucing up their properties. For example, The Mirage has added new LED lighting and updated its lobby areas.</p>
<p>As well as providing employment opportunities for locals, the film is also expected to generate significant revenue for businesses in Las Vegas through tourism. In fact, it has been estimated that a studio feature can bring in as much as $90 million to a location over the course of its production.</p>
<p>With filming set to begin imminently, tourists and locals alike can expect to see plenty of activity on the Strip over the coming weeks!</p>
<h1 id="Four-Holds-Casino-to-start-filming-this-week"><a href="#Four-Holds-Casino-to-start-filming-this-week" class="headerlink" title="Four Holds Casino to start filming this week"></a>Four Holds Casino to start filming this week</h1><p>Four Holds Casino, the new movie starring Dwayne Johnson, will start filming this week. The production has been in the works for a while now, with the release date set for next year.</p>
<p>Johnson will be playing the lead role in the movie, which is about a casino security guard who turns to robbing casinos to save his family. The cast also includes Michael Pena and Charlotte Le Bon.</p>
<p>The movie is being directed by filmmaker Stephen Gaghan, who won an Oscar for writing Traffic. This will be his first time directing a movie.</p>
<p>The crew has been spotted in Las Vegas recently, getting ready to start filming. They have been doing some rehearsals and last-minute preparations before starting production on Monday.</p>
<p>This is one of the most anticipated movies of next year, and it looks like it is going to be a big hit with audiences. Make sure to check out Four Holds Casino when it hits theaters in early 2020!</p>
<h1 id="First-look-at-Dean-Cain-in-Four-Holds-Casino"><a href="#First-look-at-Dean-Cain-in-Four-Holds-Casino" class="headerlink" title="First look at Dean Cain in Four Holds Casino"></a>First look at Dean Cain in Four Holds Casino</h1><p>When I think of Dean Cain, I think of Superman. I never would have guessed that he could convincingly play a Las Vegas casino owner in the new film Four Hold Casino. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and has yet to receive a U.S. release date, but trailers are beginning to surface and they look promising.</p>
<p>In the film, Cain stars as Harry Dalton, a casino owner who is trying to keep his business afloat. He’s up against some tough competition from a rival casino and things are starting to look bleak. In order to save his casino, Harry employs some questionable tactics that put him on the wrong side of the law.</p>
<p>Dean Cain is always great in leading man roles and it looks like he does a great job in this one too. The cast also includes Armand Assante and Michael Madsen, so you know it’s going to be good. I’m excited to see this film when it comes out and I’m sure that it will be a success.</p>
<h1 id="Four-Holds-Casino-set-to-begin-filming-this-week"><a href="#Four-Holds-Casino-set-to-begin-filming-this-week" class="headerlink" title="Four Holds Casino set to begin filming this week"></a>Four Holds Casino set to begin filming this week</h1><p>Four Holds Casino is set to begin filming this week in Winnipeg. The project is a joint venture between Prairie Theatre Exchange and Manitoba Film and Music. The cast includes local talent as well as some well-known actors including Michelle Thrush and Tantoo Cardinal.</p>
<p>The story follows the journey of two First Nations brothers, played by Adam Beach and Brandon Oakes, who travel to Winnipeg to gamble at the casino. They soon find out that their fellow players are in for more than they bargained for.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited to work with Prairie Theatre Exchange and Manitoba Film and Music on this project,” said Beach. “It’s going to be a great opportunity for local talent to show off their skills and for audiences to see some familiar faces on the big screen.”</p>
<p>The film is expected to wrap up production in late November.</p>
