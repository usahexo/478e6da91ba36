The game can be addictive and emotionally damaging because it often leads to people feeling like they are not good enough or never doing enough.</p>
<p>People often play the Good Girl,Good Girl Game with their parents in childhood, hoping to win their approval and avoid punishment. As adults, we can continue to play this game with romantic partners, friends, colleagues and even strangers. The goal of the game is to make the other person happy while neglecting our own needs. We might do things like always say yes, put others’ comfort before our own, and constantly put others first.</p>
<p>The problem with playing the Good Girl, Good Girl Game is that it can lead to feelings of isolation and emptiness.
