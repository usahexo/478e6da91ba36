        <h1 id="Gambling-Age-Set-To-Increase-In-All-States"><a href="#Gambling-Age-Set-To-Increase-In-All-States" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age Set To Increase In All States"></a>Gambling Age Set To Increase In All States</h1><p>All states are set to increase the gambling age from 18 to 21 years old. This means that no-one below the age of 21 will be able to gamble in any form or fashion within that state. The only exception is for horse race betting, which will still remain at 18 years old.</p>
<p>The change has been made as a response to the growing problem of gambling addiction amongst young people. It is hoped that by increasing the gambling age, it will help to protect vulnerable young people from developing an addiction.</p>
<p>In some states, the change has already taken place, while in others it will be implemented over the next few years. So far, the reaction from the public has been mixed. Some people feel that 21 is too young an age to be gambling, while others argue that it is still too easy for young people to get their hands on gambling products, regardless of their age.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this change plays out in different states and whether it makes a difference to the number of people who develop gambling addictions.</p>
<h1 id="Federal-Government-set-to-introduce-new-gambling-legislation"><a href="#Federal-Government-set-to-introduce-new-gambling-legislation" class="headerlink" title="Federal Government set to introduce new gambling legislation"></a>Federal Government set to introduce new gambling legislation</h1><p>In a surprise move, the Federal government has announced it will be introducing new gambling legislation to Parliament next week. The proposed bill is designed to regulate the online gambling industry and protect consumers from unscrupulous operators.</p>
<p>According to the government, the new bill will establish a national licensing and regulatory framework for online gambling sites. This will include requirements for operators to meet consumer protection standards, including disclosure of odds and prohibition on unfair terms and practices.</p>
<p>The government also plans to introduce a new offence of providing unlicensed gambling services, which will carry a penalty of up to five years imprisonment or a fine of $500,000.</p>
<p>“This is an important step in ensuring that Australian consumers are protected when they gamble online,” said the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Kelly O’Dwyer. “The legislation will establish a clear and rigorous framework for regulating online gambling, which will help to keep Australians safe and informed.”</p>
<p>Online gambling has become increasingly popular in Australia in recent years, with around two-thirds of internet users reporting having gambled online in some form. However, there have been concerns about the lack of regulation of the industry and the potential for scams and unfair practices.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that the government is taking action to address these concerns,” said O’Dwyer. “The new legislation will ensure that Australian consumers have a safe and fair experience when gambling online.”</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-age-increase-could-lead-to-more-problem-gambling-cases"><a href="#Gambling-age-increase-could-lead-to-more-problem-gambling-cases" class="headerlink" title="Gambling age increase could lead to more problem gambling cases"></a>Gambling age increase could lead to more problem gambling cases</h1><p>A recent study has shown that the number of problem gamblers could rise significantly if the gambling age is increased from 18 to 21. The research, conducted by Oxford University, involved interviewing 2,000 people across the UK about their gambling habits.</p>
<p>The study found that if the gambling age was raised, more young people would gamble illegally and this could lead to an increase in problem gambling cases. It was also found that around two-thirds of people who gamble before the legal age do so without problems, while just 1% of those over 21 have issues with gambling.</p>
<p>Those in favour of increasing the gambling age argue that it would help protect young people from developing a problem with gambling. However, opponents of the move say that it would be counterproductive as it would push gambling underground and make it harder for authorities to regulate it.</p>
<p>The issue is currently being debated in Parliament and a decision is expected soon.</p>
<h1 id="Majority-of-Australians-support-raising-the-gambling-age"><a href="#Majority-of-Australians-support-raising-the-gambling-age" class="headerlink" title="Majority of Australians support raising the gambling age"></a>Majority of Australians support raising the gambling age</h1><p>According to a recent study, the majority of Australians support raising the gambling age from 18 to 21. </p>
<p>The research, conducted by The Australia Institute (TAI), found that 64% of respondents agreed that the gambling age should be increased, while only 26% disagreed. Furthermore, 71% of participants said they would be more likely to support a political party that pledged to raise the gambling age. </p>
<p>TAI Director Ben Oquist said the results showed there was strong public support for measures to better protect people from problem gambling. “It’s clear from our polling that the community wants strong action on gambling, including increasing the gambling age,” he said. </p>
<p>The study also found that a majority of Australians (56%) believe that problem gambling is a major national problem. This is up from 47% in 2016 and 27% in 2009. </p>
<p>In response to these findings, Oquist called for the Federal Government to take stronger action on gambling, including increasing the gambling age. “These numbers show there is overwhelming public support for stronger action on gambling – including increasing the gambling age – and it’s time for Malcolm Turnbull and his government to listen and act,” he said. </p>
<p>While there has been some debate over whether or not to increase the gambling age, it seems clear from this research that most Australians support such a move. It will be interesting to see what actions, if any, the Federal Government takes in light of these findings.</p>

<p>“My son started gambling when he was just eighteen,” Judi recalls sadly. “He would sneak out to the casino with his friends and gamble away all of his money. I had no idea what was going on until he started getting into debt and borrowing money from me to feed his addiction.”</p>
<p>Judi’s son is now twenty-four and is still addicted to gambling. He has lost his job, his home, and most of his friends as a result of his addiction. “He’s a different person now,” Judi says. “He’s angry and depressed, and I don’t know how to help him.”</p>
<p>Judi is urging the government to raise the gambling age from eighteen to twenty-one in an effort to prevent more young people from falling victim to this devastating addiction. “I don’t want any other families to go through what we’ve gone through,” she says. “This addiction can ruin lives, and it needs to be treated seriously.”</p>
