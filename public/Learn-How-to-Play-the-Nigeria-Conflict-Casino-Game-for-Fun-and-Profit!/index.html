<p> Conflict is a popular casino game that can be found in many online and land-based casinos. The game is played with cards, and the objective is to beat the dealer’s hand. There are many different variants of the game, so gamers can find one that suits their preference. Some of the most popular variants include Atlantic City Blackjack, Spanish 21 Blackjack, and Double Exposure Blackjack.</p>
<p>When playing Conflict casino games, it is important to understand the rules of the game. This will help ensure that you make the most of your gaming experience. The basic rules of blackjack are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer or by having a higher total score than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A player is dealt two cards face up and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to win, the player must have a higher total score than the dealer without going over 21. If the player goes over 21, they lose automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A player may hit (draw another card) or stand (no additional cards).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A blackjack (an Ace plus any card worth 10 points) beats any other combination except for a blackjack achieved by the dealer. In this case, both hands push (tie).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Blackjack is a very popular casino game that offers plenty of excitement and thrills. When playing blackjack, it is important to remember these basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The object of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over 21. The player competes against the dealer who also has two cards - one shown face up and one hidden from view.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives players an advantage as they know what card has been dealt out from their deck officially making it 51 v 52&#x3D;%0 intact with adjoined gambles for split &amp;double at no extra charges </p>
<ul>
<li>To win at blackjack, your hand must be higher than that of the dealer but not exceed 21. If you go over 21 then you automatically lose regardless what card value your opponent has showing.<br>  - In order for players to receive more cards they say “Hit me” which alerts dealers they would like another card dealt onto their Hand &amp; Stand stops receiving cards telling dealers signifying “No More Cards Plz!”<br>  - 3 Card Brag might seem similar however; poker professional James Akenhead won £116000 in bets on a three day knees up in May 2009 making it Britains biggest gambling payout beating 5 times his original buy in amount!</li>
